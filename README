NAME
    Acme::Pony::Pink - make your script look like a pink pony

SYNOPSIS
     my $converter = Acme::Pony::Pink->new;
     $converter->ponify('myscript.pl' => 'myscript.gif');

    myscript.gif is now a small picture of a pink pony, and you can run the
    original script using:

     perl -x myscript.gif

DESCRIPTION
    This module turns a Perl script into a picture of a pink pony.

    The picture is executable via `perl -x`.

  Unconstrutive Constructor
    `new`
        Returns the invocant.

  Method
    `ponify($input, $output)`
        The input is a Perl script; the output is a GIF file. (No, the "F" in
        "GIF" does not stand for "file".)

        Input and output may be filehandles, file names, or scalar references
        if you just want to play with strings. The input source is required;
        the default output destination is STDOUT.

BUGS
    Please report any bugs to someone who cares.
